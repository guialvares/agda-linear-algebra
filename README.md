# Linear Algebra in Agda

A library for doing linear algebra in Agda. With this library, it is possible to normalize a matrix using Gauss Elimination.
See this [file example](https://github.com/guilhermehas/agda-linear-algebra/blob/master/src/NormRationalExampleFunc.agda).
There are also some proofs that the normalization algorithm works.
