+ Some discussion about the LinAlg library and its interface.
+ NiBo argues that this type is too hard to understand for the user.
solveSimple : (A : Matrix F n m) (b : Vec F n) â†’ solSimpleT $ solve $ system A b
+ Perhaps present
solveSimple' : Matrix F n m -> Vec F n -> Maybe (Vec F m)
+ to the user, together with
solveSpec1 :  (A : Matrix F n m) (b : Vec F n) (x : Vec F m) ->
              (solveSimple' A b == Just x) ->
	      A * x ==  b
+ and some corresponding spec. in the "opposite direction" - perhaps:
solveSpec2 :  (A : Matrix F n m) (b : Vec F n) (x : Vec F m) ->
              (A * x ==  b) ->
	      Exists (Vec F m) \y ->
	      (solveSimple' A b == Just y)
** Octave details
+ Comparing to octave
A = [1 1; 1 -1]
b = [3 ; 1]
x = A \ b
check = A*x-b  -- should be the zero vector

B = [1 1; 1 1]
y = B\b
check = B*y-b  -- is not the zero vector

There is also linsolve(A,b), similar to (\).
