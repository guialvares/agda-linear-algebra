Starting from the linear equation system
  A * x = b
the library will compute a "solution description" with a few
alternatives:
  
    No
  | One Vec
  | Several SubSpace

and a proof that
  + all solutions generated from the "solution description" satisfy the equation.
  + all solutions of the system are contained in the "solution description"

----------------

You may also want to present the "generalised inverse" of A and some
more things. If the matrix is square you want to compute the
determinant. And in combination with having polynomials as matrix elements that
