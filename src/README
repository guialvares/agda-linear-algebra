This library depends on a github version (from 2022-12-30) of the agda
stdlib - newer than version 1.7.1 but older that version 1.7.2
(released 2023-02-01).
https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/commit/f7bfeba6cfc03b9488e6d91ea0b011831f53be8a

Details can be found in file:../_sources/generated.nix

      owner = "agda";
      repo = "agda-stdlib";
      rev = "f7bfeba6cfc03b9488e6d91ea0b011831f53be8a";

Using the nix-version requires the flag --local-interfaces to agda so that
Agda can continue even with a read-only library directory.
