* Overview of the linear algebra library
+ You need to present the "API" for the library early (here).
** Key concepts / types:
+ |Vec A n|      -- the type of n-element vectors of type A
  + Defined in stdlib in Data/Vec/Base.agda
+ |Vector A n|   -- the type of n-element vectors of type A
  + Defined in stdlib in Data/Vec/Functional.agda (as Fin n -> A)
+ |Matrix A m n| -- the type of m-by-n matrices of elements of type A
  + Defined in Algebra/Matrix.agda
    + indirectly in Algebra/Matrix/Base.agda (implemented as vector of vectors)
+ TODO other types?
    
** Key operation / functions
+ |normalizeD : Matrix n m -> Matrix m n|
  + TODO Correct type?
  + TODO where defined?
  + TODO (what does "D" mean)
+ TODO other operations? (build matrices, take them apart, multiply, etc.)
  + not too many!

** Key properties / theorems / lemmas
+ TODO
  +   


NormRationalExampleFunc.agda

* Other comments
+ There are two files with similar names:
  + NormRationalExample.agda
  + NormRationalExampleFunc.agda
** TODO are they implementing the same thing with different types? 
+ How are they related? (Examples/PendulumDimension.agda?)
